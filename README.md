# IOT-BASED-EYE-TRACKING-SYSTEM-FOR-PARALYSIS-PATIENTS-
IoT-based assistive system that enables paralysis patients to control appliances and communicate using eye-blink detection with ESP32 and IR sensors.

## Project Overview
An IoT-based assistive system designed to help paralysis patients control household appliances and communicate using eye-blink gestures. The system uses IR sensors to detect eye blinks and an ESP32/NodeMCU microcontroller to process signals and trigger appliance control through relay modules.

## Objectives
- Enable hands-free interaction for paralysis patients
- Improve patient independence and accessibility
- Provide a low-cost IoT-based healthcare assistive solution

## System Architecture
- Eye blink detection using IR sensors
- ESP32 / NodeMCU for signal processing
- Relay-based appliance control
- Wi-Fi connectivity for monitoring and control

## Technologies Used
- Microcontroller: ESP32 / NodeMCU
- Sensors: IR Eye Blink Sensor
- Programming: Embedded C / Arduino
- Connectivity: Wi-Fi (IoT)
- Tools: Arduino IDE
